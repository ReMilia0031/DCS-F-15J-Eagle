F-15J DCS Mod
==================================================
F-15J flyable mod based on the default F-15C.

It's implemented as a clickable cockpit, but it's barely functional.

By changing the "/Cockpit/Scripts/" part of the make_flyable line to "/Cockpit/KneeboardRight/", it will be the same as the FC3 Aircraft.
