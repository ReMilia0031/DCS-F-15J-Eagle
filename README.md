F-15J DCS Mod<br>
==================================================<br>
F-15J flyable mod based on the default F-15C.<br>
It's implemented as a clickable cockpit, but it's barely functional.<br>
By changing the "/Cockpit/Scripts/" part of the make_flyable line to "/Cockpit/KneeboardRight/", it will be the same as the FC3 Aircraft.<br>
